    "# Job Quality Indicators and the American Workforce\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "This study is motivated by the desire to actively learn more about the American workforce through the application of data science models, methods, and principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the average American, life has only gotten worse. Income inequality has risen at dramatic rates as unions were disemboweled, leaving workers to beg alone (and uselessly) for higher salaries; various regulations, including Glass Steagle were rolled back; taxation for the wealthiest Americans decreased. As a result, the middle class has been hollowed out, and the majority of the Americans find themselves on the middle of an island in the bell curve. To their left lie the poor, and to their right lie the upper middle class and the wealthy; and they are less likely than ever to become wealthier, and liklier than ever to become poorer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wealth is largely measured as the sum of one's assets, and is not largely correlated with income. (PK, 2021) Net worth is the most common measure (described previously) of wealth, and is \"a function of inheritance, past levels of disposable income, the propensity to save, and the return on investments.\" It is \"difficult or impossible\" to measure these factors in a household survey, hence the lack of models that consider causality and wealth. (Lamas and McNeil, 1985). \n",
    "\n",
    "In lieu of such an indicator, household income suffices as a point of reference for economic classification and relative economic clout.\n",
    "\n",
    "A no-brainer correlate would then be income; naturally, there is likely to be a strong and significant correlation between the two. However, in the interest of breaking these things down to a more human level, one could also use pay rate (pay/hour).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pay rate is important in that it represents how much your work is worth; is your work worth $\\$3,200$ a month or $20 an hour? The monthly estimate helps us make sense of how much our labor can pay for, and is also robust in terms of comparing it to someone else. The most digestible, however, is pay rate as an hourly wage. Calculating something, even hypothetically (e.g., salaries), as an hourly pay rate, has one key benefit: it reduces the final estimate, which makes rates easier to compare against each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our first hypothesis, household income was used to predict pay rate. Unsurprisingly, there is a very strong correlation between pay rate and income class. Most importantly, this model can be used to roughly classify how stark the differences between the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the data scientist, it is critical that data is systematically, reliably processed. Understanding how this data came to be (e.g., the sampling methods and interview methodologies of the census, the processing of the data in this study itself) is as critical as what the models show us. One of the key metamotivational factors of this study is the desire to accurately convey how it came to its conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "This study is concerned with the conditions of the American working class. For the purposes of this study, working class is synonymous with wage earner. More specifically, a member of the working class is someone whose income comes primarily from wages.\n",
    "\n",
    "If one were to draw a distinction between the working class and the capital-owning class (people who make most of their money through labor vs. people who make most of their money through capital gains), it would be: if this person lost their job tomorrow, would they be able to rely on their capital investments to not work for an extended period of time? If the answer is no, they are working class. If the answer is yes, they are not. This is a rough qualitative description of the classes at best, but helps to illustrate the position of wage earners by contrasting them to capital earners.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scope of this study is to describe relationships between positive job quality indicators and current job outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pay Rate\n",
    "\n",
    "This study is primarily concerned with differences in pay rate between different classes of people (based on household income, education, job class, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pay rate is calculated as a function of income earned per week divided by hours worked per week:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{weekly pay rate} =  \\dfrac{income}{hours}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Pay rate describes, essentially, how much money an individual makes per hour, regardless of whether they are paid hourly. This allows us to view the overall trend between the categories, and also provides a point of comparison between employees who are paid hourly and those who receive a salary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there is a very large difference between the pay rates of hourly and salaried employees: salaried employees systematically receive a higher pay rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Auditing and Cleansing\n",
    "\n",
    "Data was filtered to more accurately approximate the population of interest, Americans who earn the majority of their income through wages or salaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis 1: the income class-only hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Pay rate is a measure of hourly income. Economic class, which this study simplifies into lower, upper, and middle economic class, is determined by adjusted household income. Classification is detemined by the adjusted income of a household relatice to the median adjusted household income of the sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Economic mobility in the United States it at a historic low. (Citation needed) Research indicates that the quality of a current individual's job is greatly determined by that individual's starting wealth, which can be used to capitalize on networking and other opportunities that require capital investment that is easier to achieve for individuals with higher starting capital. (Citation needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis 1 posits that the pay rate of working Americans is explained to a great degree by current income class.\n",
    "1. Lower-income status is associated with the least pay rate.\n",
    "2. Upper-income status is associated with the highest pay rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hypothesis is likely to be true due to the causal relationship between job income and household income. For one-person households, or households where one individual earns a the majority of income, the job income of that individual will largely determine their household, and therefore their income class.\n",
    "\n",
    "If hypothesis 1 is true, it indicates that your current pay rate is strongly related to the income of the household you belonged to last year (household income is actually a measure of the previous year's household income).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hypothesis 1: functional form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(x) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{middle-income}X_{middle-income} + \\beta_{upper-income}X_{upper-income} +\\epsilon_{income}, $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\beta_{0}+\\epsilon_{income}$ is the baseline term and represents the coefficient estimate for lower-income people."

    "\n",
    "Now, heat maps may be used for quantitatively qualifying categorical variables. However, as a rule of thumb, a categorical variable cannot be put in a correlation table with a quantitative variable, because often the resulting correlation is a number that does not represent anything.\n",

    "Most of the variables in the dataset are in fact categorical - so why keep using correlation heat maps? The answer, simply put, is that they are somewhat indicative. For instance, any NA correlations between one variable and all others represent singularities. The heat map helps us spot these variables very intuitively, and makes targeting them for removal easily."

    " The union membership variable in the above correlation table is negatively correlated with income. That makes no sense, as we know that \"Workers with union representation enjoy a significant pay premium compared to non-union workers.\" (United States Department of Labor). The answer lies in the codes. If yes is coded to a lesser value than no, then the correlation appears to be negative. However, when those codes are flipped, the reverse is true. Both are equally representative of reality. Crucially, the latter method allows us to leverage human heuristics instead of forcing human readers to pause and consider the coding."

Where an employee at any given company is more likely to use company resources as their means of production, self-employed people typically acquire their own tools, software, etc., which means they may be more likely to have their own means of production. By that metric, their means of production are likely to be systematically different, in that self-employed people are more likely to own the means of their own production vs. the employed. This likely significant difference provides additional grounds for their exclusion, beyond their pay not being defined by the traditional wage."

    "It cannot be neglected that the United States functions as an empire, with various tributary states with no political representation (Puerto Rico, Guam, etc.) and other states which the United States controls through economic means, with the threat of military coercion and soft power influence always apparent, ensuring the United States gets the lion's share of profits from most enterprises involving resource extraction, including labor extraction, where labor extraction is defined as the labor in those countries is cheaper, and is largely used to benefit trade networks that result in profits for the American patrician class, i.e. the limited number of people with sufficient capital to exert influence over the functioning of American industries and the actions of the government. The most globaly-inflluential industries, not by coincidence, are those of war and international banking, both which back and reinforce the ultimate power of the American dollar. \n",
    "\n",
    "That is to say that the current mystification of class is inseparable from the American empire. One theory may be that this obfuscation may be seen as an optimal way to prevent rank and file Americans from recognizing the despicable actions required to maintain any empire.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving onward in our analysis of data, I feel it is imperative to note the tributary nature of economies that the U.S. largely controls (particularly in South America). As mentioned, profit is extracted from these states by capitalizing on the low investment cost (cheap labor, lack of safety regulations, ability to coerce/control the economically-dependent and independently powerless state) reaping billions of dollars in rewards for the American patrician class. Because the assets of the upper classes are insufficiently taxed, the tribute from these states is primarily used to add to the wealth of the patrician class, precluding the lower and middle classes from the wealth of the empire, and even precluding the state from capitalizing on the profits that would not exist without it. The American patrician class, reaping the lion's share of the reward, not only add massively to their fantastic wealth, but further consolidate their power through consolidation of their wealth. This is easily-demonstrated through the extremely low density of people that control the greatest shares of wealth, visible even at the lowest levels of the upper class, the millionaires (though it is important to note that a simple millionaire is not remotely comparable to a member of the patrician class in terms of power, wealth, and social status: it would be like compaing a Roman soldier to a Roman emperor, so great is the disparity that using an equestrian as a stand-in for the millionaire class is inept for the metaphor).\n",
    "\n",
    "By and large, the mystification of class prevents people in the lower and middle classes from recognizing the sheer level of disparity between them and the upper-income class. The upper-income class is in turn also robbed of a tool which would inform them that they, too, are levels of magnitude away from the ruling elite, our patrician class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not to say that Americans do not have a concept of the level of division; especially as income inequality rises, the disparity is impossible not to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above all, these classes are kept complacent through readily-available mass consumption of goods and services. And the degree to which these goods are available is so great due to the power and influence of the American empire.\n",
    "\n",
    "Europeans, for various reasons, have adopted more left-wing economic and social policies, though the societies of europe are entirely capitalist. The application of left-wing principles is inherent to the welfare component of these states, and the left-wing drum continues to be hammered on by the efforts in labor unions accross Europe.\n",
    "\n",
    "European coutries and the USA are capitalist representative democracies in the Western core of the American empire, with a good degree of cultural exchange and shared cultural heritage. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to apply European economic research to the United States. But, because the goals of any given European country and academic bias of any given research institution, the particular details of implementation, as well as the class makeup, is different enough to warrant a level of caution when applying European metrics to the USA.\n",
    "\n",
    "One finding of European research on class, which is not independent from the American tradition of research on class, is that classes exist on social as well as economic levels. The Great British Class Survey considers 3 separate vectors: economic, social, and cultural status signifiers, and hypothesizes that together, these vectors (and their many components) explain the modern contruct of social class.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the vectors that makes up social status is education, and it is theorized that the level of one's education is related to whether one is in the lower, middle, or upper social class.\n",

Meanwhile, the difference between a middle-clas person with a high school education and one with a bachelor's is $\\$1.68$.
